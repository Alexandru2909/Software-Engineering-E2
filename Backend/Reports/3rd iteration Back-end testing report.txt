WebParserV3
	- change minSdkVersion from 21 to 26  (build.gradle)
	- typo in error report
	- in dataRecord setRoomRecord and setValue are basically the same function, no need to keep them both
	- in WebParser, the path to the files shoud be determined automatically so it can run on a mobile phone without modifining in code every time, because 		of that the app should also request access to files (probably)
	- app should be made conncurent using multiple threads(eventually)
	- try to make functions return values for easier testing
