# IMPORTANT NOTICE
Seeing as we now have a functional version of our module, I do not want to see anyone BREAKING the code.
Before committing, make sure the application functions correctly, so that we do not run into more bugs than we'd like.

# ALSO:
To keep everything and everyone synchronized, please do install and utilize GitHub Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/
And make suggestive commit messages. (NO "Add files via upload" or any message of the sort)
